<p>RAM is a component in Cisco switches but not in Cisco routers.</p>
<p>RAM is able to store multiple versions of IOS and configuration files.</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
RAM stores data that is used by the device to support network operations. The running configuration is stored in RAM. This type of memory is considered volatile memory because data is lost during a power cycle. Flash memory stores the IOS and delivers a copy of the IOS into RAM when a device is powered on. Flash memory is nonvolatile since it retains stored contents during a loss of power.</p></div>
<h3>15. Which interface allows remote management of a Layer 2 switch?</h3>
<p>the AUX interface</p>
<p>the console port interface</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the switch virtual interface*</strong></span></p>
<p>the first Ethernet port interface</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
In a Layer 2 switch, there is a switch virtual interface (SVI) that provides a means for remotely managing the device.</p></div>
<h3>16. Which interface is the default SVI on a Cisco switch?</h3>
<p>FastEthernet 0/1</p>
<p>GigabitEthernet 0/1</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>VLAN 1*</strong></span></p>
<p>VLAN 99</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
An SVI is a virtual interface and VLAN 1 is enabled by default on Cisco switches. VLAN 99 must be configured to be used. FastEthernet 0/1 and GigabitEthernet 0/1 are physical interfaces.</p></div>
<h3>17. Why would a Layer 2 switch need an IP address?</h3>
<p>to enable the switch to send broadcast frames to attached PCs</p>
<p>to enable the switch to function as a default gateway</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>to enable the switch to be managed remotely*</strong></span></p>
<p>to enable the switch to receive frames from attached PCs</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
A switch, as a Layer 2 device, does not need an IP address to transmit frames to attached devices. However, when a switch is accessed remotely through the network, it must have a Layer 3 address. The IP address must be applied to a virtual interface rather than to a physical interface. Routers, not switches, function as default gateways.</p></div>
<h3>18. What command can be used on a Windows PC to see the IP configuration of that computer?</h3>
<p>ping</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ipconfig*</strong></span></p>
<p>show interfaces</p>
<p>show ip interface brief</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
On a Windows PC, the <b>ipconfig</b> command can be used to verify the current IP configuration. The <b>ping</b> command can be used to verify connectivity to other network devices. The <b>show interfaces </b>and <b>show ip interface brief </b>commands are both Cisco IOS commands that are used to see the status of router and switch interfaces.</p></div>
<h3>19. A technician is adding a new PC to a LAN. After unpacking the components and making all the connections, the technician starts the PC. After the OS loads, the technician opens a browser, and verifies that the PC can reach the Internet. Why was the PC able to connect to the network with no additional configuration?</h3>
<p>The PC does not require any additional information to function on the network.</p>
<p>The PC came preconfigured with IP addressing information from the factory.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The PC was preconfigured to use DHCP.*</strong></span></p>
<p>The PC used DNS to automatically receive IP addressing information from a server.</p>
<p>The PC virtual interface is compatible with any network.</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
The new PC was preconfigured to use DHCP. When the PC is connected to a network that uses DHCP, it gets the IP address settings from the DHCP server that will allow it to function on the network. All devices require at least an IP address and subnet mask to function on a LAN. DNS does not automatically configure addresses on hosts. PC virtual interfaces are not universally compatible with LANs and do not necessarily provide a host with an IP address. At this place in the course, virtual interfaces are used on network switches.</p></div>
<h3>20. What is a user trying to determine when issuing a ping 10.1.1.1 command on a PC?</h3>
<p>if the TCP/IP stack is functioning on the PC without putting traffic on the wire</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>if there is connectivity with the destination device*</strong></span></p>
<p>the path that traffic will take to reach the destination</p>
<p>what type of device is at the destination</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
The ping destination command can be used to test connectivity.</p></div>
<h3>21. Refer to the exhibit. A network technician is testing connectivity in a new network. Based on the test results shown in the exhibit, which device does the technician have connectivity with and which device does the technician not have connectivity with? (Choose two.)</h3>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>connectivity: switch 2*</strong></span></p>
<p>connectivity: PC-D</p>
<p>connectivity: PC-B</p>
<p>no connectivity: switch 1</p>
<p>no connectivity: switch 2</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>no connectivity: PC-C*</strong></span></p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
The exhibit shows ping tests to two devices. One device has the IP address of 192.168.1.2, which is switch 2. The other test is to the IP address of 192.168.1.21, which is host PC-C. For the first test, to switch 2, the results are successful, with four reply messages received. This means that connectivity exists to switch 2. For the second test, all four messages timed out. This indicates that connectivity does not exist to PC-C.</p></div>
<h3>22. Refer to the exhibit. What three facts can be determined from the viewable output of the show ip interface brief command? (Choose three.)</h3>

<p>Two physical interfaces have been configured.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The switch can be remotely managed.*</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>One device is attached to a physical interface.*</strong></span></p>
<p>Passwords have been configured on the switch.</p>
<p>Two devices are attached to the switch.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The default SVI has been configured.*</strong></span></p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
Vlan1 is the default SVI. Because an SVI has been configured, the switch can be configured and managed remotely. FastEthernet0/0 is showing up and up, so a device is connected.</p></div>
<h3>23. An administrator is configuring a switch console port with a password. In what order will the administrator travel through the IOS modes of operation in order to reach the mode in which the configuration commands will be entered? (Not all options are used.)</h3>

<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
The configuration mode that the administrator first encounters is user EXEC mode. After the enable command is entered, the next mode is privileged EXEC mode. From there, the configure terminal command is entered to move to global configuration mode. Finally, the administrator enters the line console 0 command to enter the mode in which the configuration will be entered.</p></div>
<h3>24. Match the definitions to their respective CLI hot keys and shortcuts. (Not all options are used.)</h3>
